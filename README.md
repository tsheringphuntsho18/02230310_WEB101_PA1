I have added, search bar where users can search for pokemon both by id and name. I am also trying to add the functionality of searching pokemon by pictures.

I added view details buttton and all the details of the pokemon is shown.

## PokeAPI
My pokedex uses pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon) for fetching data related to pokemon.
